# FlappySquare
 A very small flappy bird clone project

The project is super simple as it contains 4 scripts, 1 scene.

PlayerController is responsible for moving the character and detecting whether the player has collided with a pipe or passed through it.
GameManager is responsible for updating the score text and restarting the level.
PipesManager is responsible for generating and updating the position of pipes.
Constants stores the constant values of strings used through out the game.
